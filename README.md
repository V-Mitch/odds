Steps:  
I. GOAL DEFINITION  
Analyze & predict outcome of football games using Machine Learning techniques. Demonstrate knowledge and develop a working model.  
  
II. Data collection & preparation âœ…  
  1. Research other solutions for inspirations/benchmarking  
  2. Collect data from API âœ…  
  3. Parse player/fixture statistsics and information into dataframes that are usable and readable âœ…  
  4. Player rankings/injuries data structured ðŸ•’  
  5. FIFA rankings data added âœ…
  
III. Feature Engineering  
  1. Divide forward looking and backward looking data âœ…  
  2. Create methods/functions to summarize past match data âœ…  
  3. Create imputation method(s) to fill missing data âœ…
  
III. Model training   
  1. Select and prepare a model appropriate for the problem âœ…  
  2. Establish train/test procedure âœ…
  
IV. Model Evaluation  
  1. Re-Evaluate all of the above through observations/results ðŸ•’  
  2. Find metrics / visuals to better evaluate the results âœ…
  
V. Model Deployment/Serving/Monnitoring/Maintenance  
  out-of-scope  
    

Current state: Code needs cleaning but functional.
  
Outcome: Achieved **~60% accuracy and ~56% F1 score** on Win/Draw/Loss classification problem for the national men's football data.  
Weakness: Predicting draws is very difficult, as explained in the literature. Currently looking for a work-around. One solution has been oversampling or the changing of case-weights in the classification problem.
