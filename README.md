2024 Project 
Goal: analyze & predict outcome of football games using Machine Learning techniques.

Steps: 
I. GOAL DEFINITION
II. Data collection & preparation âœ…
  1. Research other solutions for inspirations/benchmarking 
  2. Collect data from API âœ…
  3. Parse player/fixture statistsics and information into dataframes that are usable and readable âœ…
  4. Player rankings/injuries data structured ðŸ•’
  5. FIFA rankings data added âœ…
III. Feature Engineering
  1. Divide forward looking and backward looking data âœ…
  2. Create methods/functions to summarize past match data âœ…
  3. Create imputation method(s) to fill missing data âœ…
III. Model training
  1. Select and prepare a model appropriate for the problem âœ…
  2. Establish train/test procedure âœ…
IV. Model Evaluation
  1. Re-Evaluate all of the above through observations/results ðŸ•’
  2. Find metrics / visuals to better evaluate the results âœ…
V. Model Deployment/Serviong/Monnitoring/Maintenance
  out-of-scope
  

Current state: Code needs cleaning but functional.

Outcome: Achieved ~60% accuracy and ~56% F1 score on Win/Draw/Loss classification problem for the national men's football data.
